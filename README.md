# Module 19 Challenge:Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose for Analysis:
The purpose of this project is to create an analysis for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.
The client, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked us to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, it has decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we will be using a hierarchical clustering unsupervised machine learning algorithm and data visualizations to share the findings with the board.
